Develop an application for registering phone notes.

A phone note contains the following information:
 name of caller
 phone number of the caller
 date and time of the call
 notes

The application should contain the following functionalities:
 An overview (listing) of your own notes only sorted by
date/time (descending order)
 Editing of only your personal notes (add / modify / delete)
 Downloading PDF of the overview of the personal phone notes
 Option to send the PDF as an attachment to a predefined
(hardcoded) email address
 Responsive page/listing (desktop – mobile)
 Use a javascript date picker
 If you have spare time: Implement infinity scroll
Furthermore, it requires some restrictions:
 Add authentication to the whole application — presume it
contains sensitive privacy data.
 Add user self-registration via a web form. Instead of sending a
confirmation email, just log the confirmation link. It’s not
necessary to provide a user management interface.
 Add password reset (“forgotten password”) functionality. Here
it’s also ok to just log the confirmation link in any place.
We suggest:
- Use PHP (you can use plugins if you want)
- Use MySQL or SQLite database
- You can use any framework
- Add at least 5 persons (examples) to the phone notes
